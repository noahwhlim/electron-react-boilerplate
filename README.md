# Electron React App Boilerplate

This repository provides a basic boilerplate for building Electron desktop applications using React. It offers a streamlined setup to get started with your project quickly.

## Prerequisites
Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.

## Getting Started
```git clone https://github.com/noahwhlim/electron-react-boilerplate.git```

```cd electron-react-boilerplate```

```npm install```

```npm start```

## Project Structure
`main.js`: The main process entry point for Electron.

`src/`: Contains the React components and application logic.

`package.json`: Defines project metadata and dependencies.

## Building for Production
To build your application for production, run:
```npm run build```
This will create a distributable folder containing your application.

## Additional Notes
React and Electron: This boilerplate combines the power of React for building user interfaces and Electron for creating cross-platform desktop applications.
Customization: Feel free to modify and extend the boilerplate to suit your specific project needs.

For more information and advanced usage, refer to the Electron and React documentation.
